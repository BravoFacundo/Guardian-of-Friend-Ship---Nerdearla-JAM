0 Gravity asteroid defender videogame. Made in Unity, C#, for the Nerdearla JAM (1 Week long).

## Technologies

Developed using:
- C# Language
- Unity 2022.3.7f1

*You can see the code [here](Assets/_Scripts/).*

## Idea and development

This video game was designed based on the chosen theme for the game jam, which was "physical body, inner body".

The interpretation of the theme for the game was to enclose the player's "physical body" in an environment where they cannot do anything, and to direct the gameplay and interaction with the environment to the player's ability to move their "inner body", with the goal of defending the integrity of their main body."

## Implementation

The game's design and theme result in an experience where the player is trapped in a fragment of a spaceship that breaks off during an asteroid shower. 

In this scenario, the player must strive to catch the asteroids before they impact their fragment of the ship, which has few hit points. 

If the ship receives enough hits, all its panels will separate, leaving the player stranded in space.
